# single-cell Perturb-Seq pipelines

#### This repository includes 1) Hashtag data processing pipeline to quantify tag UMIs in individual cells and binarize the count table using Gaussian Mixed Modeling for model-based clustering; 2) Guide RNA data (a novel design of dual guides in vector backbone) processing pipeline to quantify guide UMIs in individual cells and binarize the count table using Gaussian Mixed Modeling; 3) Benchmarking using a test dataset generated from 10x Genomics platform.
